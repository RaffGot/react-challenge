# React + Vite

## Project Overview

In terms of architecture, I opted for a very simple structure to make the work easier. It includes pages where we have our three pages and components where we find the various project components and utilities, including the custom hook, constants, routing configuration, and routes. I decided to include the custom hook and constants to make the code more flexible and reusable. The routing configuration and routes provide a way to easily navigate between the pages.. Additionally, in the project, I used Higher Order Components (HOCs). The only library I installed was React Router.

There are many improvements that could be applied to this project if I had more time.

For example, I will work on: Code Quality and Structure, Performance Optimization, State Management, Testing, and Error Handling and Logging. I will also look into scalability and extensibility. I will also need to make sure that the code is documented and easy to understand. Finally, I will look into security and user authentication.
